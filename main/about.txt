Get To Know Me

My name is Amidou Kante and I am a 21 year old native New Yorker who aspires to be a software and web developer. My desire to learn and expand upon my skills is what has allowed for me to become something that I consider a moderan day renaissance man or polymath. 

As clich√© as it may sound, technology and art has always been apart of my life ever since I was a kid. I started off self teaching myself simple game design as well as web design. Eventually my hobby took off into something that I see as a career for me. I spend my time playing around or learning the newest technology and design principles; and I am always experimenting with different applications just to see what I can cook up and what my limits are. 

I am mainly a Front End Web Developer, that's is also capable of doing graphic design when necessary.

Fields of interest/languages(tech and social)

My core languages and skills are: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. However I am able to use jQuery, Adobe creative suite comfortably.
