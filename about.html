<div class="box"><p class="about">
I'm a Freshmen at The University of Connecticut majoring in Electrical Engineering. I spend most of my time working on side projects or trying to learn a new programming language. My hobby's include drawing, graphic design and DIY engineering.<br> <br> 
I was born and raised in Harlem, NY and hope to one day use the skills that I have acquired over the years to help out my community. Coming from a poor economic background and being of minority descent I already had a few setbacks, but I didn't let that hold me back. I hope to one day own my own business and proudly say "I made it!"
